I'm still learning Python and using these as reference guides for any employment opportunities and future projects.

This is a simple UI client that supports RESTful Post, Get, Put and Delete commands.

I'm using my [FASTapi Tool](https://github.com/BrianHammond/FAST_API_Tool) as a test since it's easy to understand.

Click on run.bat to run the program.

UI created in Qt Designer
